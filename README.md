"Observations:
1. Those in the 20-24 age bracket spend more cumulatively because this group is larger in numbers, but those who are 35-39 and <10 years old buy more expensive items. I can't make any solid inferences on why--my guess is 35-39 group buys more on average (more discretionary income?), and those under 10 years old have not gotten into extracirriculars and might hyperfixate on a game and ask for their parents' credit card.
2. The most add-ons a single player bought is only 5. If the release date of these add-ons is fairly recent, then it can be a reflection of that. If the release date is not recent, either the game has enough perks that players do not feel the need to add on or players might not think the add-ons are worth the expense.
3. The distribution of the age of the players closely resembles a bell curve, with 76.74% of the player base ages 15-29. Therefore, it might be a choice to market to that demographic (preferably without alienating the younger or older age groups)."
